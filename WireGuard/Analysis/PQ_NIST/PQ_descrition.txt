WHAT ARE PQ (PERFORMANCE QUALIFICATION) TEST SCRIPTS?
PQ test scripts (sometimes referred to as user acceptance testing) demonstrate the overall intended use of 
the system according to your procedures and processes.
They are derived from the User Requirements Specification and should reflect the day-to-day or 
end-to-end use of the system in your environment. 
PQ test scripts are executed in an environment that simulates your production environment.
PQ testing also verifies that the LIMS, ELN, or CDS is fit for its intended purpose,
operates in accordance with defined standard operating procedures, performs according to the user requirements,
and complies with 21 CFR Part 11.
This testing will also look at the support environment within which the system is to operate,
for example training or maintenance. Vendors do not often provide PQ test scripts or associated documentation,
as it is based on your intended use, processes, and procedures.
